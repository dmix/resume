job_title: UX Designer / Programmer / Analytics
summary: >
  <p>
    I consult with companies as a programmer and UX designer. I code in Ruby,
    Javascript, Go, and I play around with functional languages in my spare time
    (Erlang, Clojure, etc). I primarily build web apps, a few server apps in Go,
    and I have also developed Android apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started off as a designer but eventually became a self-taught programmer,
    spending nearly a decade developing web and mobile apps, with a focus on the
    front-end. I've also been tasked with prototyping products for various startups
    from wireframes, A/B testing, managing web analytics, and building out the
    initial MVPs. I also spent 6 months working as a Product Manager.

highlight:
  About 2yrs ago I learned how to use Erlang and fell in love with the
  simplicity and architecture of the system. I've been a big fan of FP for some
  time and was an early adopter of Clojure. I eventually switched over to
  Elixir/Phoenix when building a web app for a side project, both are my go-to
  language/frameworks after nearly a decade of Ruby on Rails. I'd love the
  opportunity to use it professionally and in production.
