job_title: Full-stack Developer / UX Designer
summary: >
  <p>
    I'm a full-stack developer and UX designer who has worked/consulted with a
    variety of startups over the last ten years.
  </p>

  <p>
    I code primarily in Ruby on Rails and Javascript (React.js, Angular, etc),
    while using functional languages in my spare time (Erlang, Elixir, Clojure,
    etc). I primarily build web apps, Android apps, and some pure server/system
    programs. But my main passion is on the front-end/product side closer to
    the user.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started off as a designer but eventually became a self-taught programmer,
    spending nearly a decade developing web and mobile apps. I've been tasked with
    prototyping products for various startups from UX design, wireframes, A/B
    testing, managing web analytics, to building out the initial MVPs. I also spent
    6 months working as a Product Manager to temporarily fill-in a vacant role
    at a startup.
  </p>

highlight:
  About two years ago I learned Erlang and fell in love with the simplicity and
  architecture of the system. I've been a big fan of functional programming for
  some time and was an early adopter of Clojure. I eventually switched over to
  Elixir/Phoenix when building a web app for a side project. Both are my go-to
  language/frameworks after nearly a decade of Ruby on Rails. I'd love the
  opportunity to use it professionally and in production.
